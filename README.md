This is a project for analyzing stock market data.
The tullow.csv file is the minute prices of tullow's shares in the London Stock Exchange.
In this codes I used moving average algorithm during 10 and 20 days. (others suggestion)
When the 10 days moving average hits 20 days moving average from down we will buy shares, and call these points the golden cross. Whenever the 10 days moving average hits the 20 days moving average from up we will buy shares, and also call these points the death cross.

I used Share profit chart, Average time inside each position, Empirical distribution of profits of positions, ... in this code to help the employer to analyze better.
Note: this was a small project for a company that they asked me to do as a freelancer for them.
